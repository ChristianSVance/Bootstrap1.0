<h1>Surf Spots</h1>

  <div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Maine</p>
    <p>The surfing in Maine is usually focused around the estuary at Ogunquit. It’s known for delivering solid, slabby right handers when the strong winter NE swells get cooking.
        Recent decades have seen surfers in Maine get a bit more experimental. There’s now a local scene in beaches around Seabury and York Harbor. North Maine, which fragments into a spattering of islands below New Brunswick is the real frontier here. Surfers do go and there have been rumors of spectacular tubes in icy waters, but no one’s telling. At least not yet.Where Maine falls down is on consistency. Cape Cod defends it from regular southerly pulses throughout much of the year, so it’s only really the fall and winter tides that can bring conditions worth jetting over from LA.
</p>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>New Hapshire</p>
    <p>New Hampshire has only 18.5 miles of coastline, islands included. That might not sound like somewhere to hit the waves, but you’d be surprised. This New England state is actually very well situated for dragging in wintertime SE swell systems from the tropics, which gather strength before hitting the river mouths here to offer some gnarly barrels. There are also other beaches – Seabrook, Jenness – that offer beginner waves and surf schools.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Massachusetts</p>
    <p>Great whites aside, MA probably deserves more attention than it gets from the East Coast surf community. There’s a nascent surf scene here but we’re often shocked at how few people are in the water, especially given the relatively reliable quality of the waves at spots like Whitecrest Beach on C others on the Atlantic side of Cape Cod. Other places like Nantasket Beach just don’t have the swell window to be able to compete with other spots in New England.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Rhode Island</p>
    <p>400 miles of surf coast await in Rhode Island. It’s actually one of the best-placed on the Eastern Seaboard for hoovering up all sorts of swell directions, so you can expect some decent summer pushes in these parts. Winter reigns supreme, though, even if you’ll be packing in under 5mils of rubber. Highlight surf spots are at Narragansett Bay, and a number of other reef and point breaks to the west and east.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Connecticut</p>
    <p>Connecticut might look like it’s in the perfect location to get the brunt of easterly Atlantic swell systems refracted through the sounds, but actually Long Island pretty much kills any good waves that hit The Constitution State. There are some spots, but serious surfers will track down to New York or New Jersey to catch those bigger swells.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>New York</p>
    <p>City surfing is very much alive and kicking in NYC. The city spreads onto a run of sandy, south-facing beaches that start with Rockaway and end with the tip of Long Island. All that gets decent swell from the outer Atlantic and the tropics, but it’s cold-water stuff that needs some thick rubber, mainly because the best A-frame peaks (NYC classics) only really work from November to March.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>New Jersey</p>
    <p>New Jersey has a real surf pedigree and offers up a whole over 114 miles of perfectly-orientated shoreline. From Fort Hancock in the north to Cape May in the south, it’s a long run of barrier isles and beach towns that get waves throughout the whole calendar. A-frame beachies are the waves people chase here. Look out for them in Island Beach State Park or at Nun’s Beach when the conditions align in winter.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Virginia</p>
    <p>Virginia Beach is home to a pier break that’s classic east coast stuff. Yea, the local crew will break your balls to steal a phrase from the seaboard vocab, but it’s a fun wave with bowly rights. It’s not the only haunt in Old Dominion, though. Sandbridge Beach can hold way more size when those nor’easterner systems cross in fall and winter. That’s where you’ll get the tubey A-frames if you’re brave enough to make the paddle.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>North Carolina</p>
    <p>There’s one place that puts North Carolina firmly up there as one of the best spots for surfing on the East Coast: The Outer Banks. Yep, this string of narrow barrier isles is our favorite surf territory in the whole region. There are waves after waves after waves, along with a unique coming-together of nor-easterner pressure systems from the north and tropical swells from the south. It’s epic stuff. The southern part of the state draws most swell from the tropics, which helps it work in summertime, too.</p>

    <p>South Carolina</p>
    <p>There’s one place that puts North Carolina firmly up there as one of the best spots for surfing on the East Coast: The Outer Banks. Yep, this string of narrow barrier isles is our favorite surf territory in the whole region. There are waves after waves after waves, along with a unique coming-together of nor-easterner pressure systems from the north and tropical swells from the south. It’s epic stuff.

  </div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Georgia</p>
    <p>Jekyll Island and Tybee Island are the premier waves in Georgia. Thing is, they’re not all that good. The Peach State really suffers from a big gap between its sands and the drop-off of the continental shelf, so most swells worth anything can be killed dead before they hit the shore. The only time that changes is with something powerful like a hurricane system in August, which can offer some rippable shoulders at certain locations.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Texas</p>
    <p>In a state that loves to go big, Texas doesn’t really have the waves to match. Reliant on whatever little splashed the Gulf of Mexico can throw its way, the coastline here isn’t really set up for proper surfing. South Padre Island – you know, that spring break mecca – is the only wave of quality and even that’s as fickle as a freshman after a keg stand.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Florida</p>
    <p>The state that gave the world a certain Kelly Slater surely has some surf, right? Of course. In fact, we’d say it’s got some of the most criminally underestimated breaks this side of the OBX. They’re getting busier every year now, but there’s frothy beach breaks all the way from Jacksonville in the north to Cocoa Beach further south. Then the Keys and Miami Beach take over for when it’s time to chillax.</p>
